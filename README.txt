This is XScreenSaver for Windows (XScreenSaverWin).

This software was based on XScreenSaver 5.22 (for non-Windows OS) by 
Jamie Zawinski.

Porting to Windows was mostly done by Katayama Hirofumi MZ.

You can download binary in the XScreenSaverWin homepage.

Check STATUS.txt for porting status.

NOTE: If you want to build the Extrusion screen saver, then 
      check the gle-3.1.0 folder.
