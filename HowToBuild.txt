How To Build
============

Just use CMake. You might have to install CMake into your development environment.

After build, double clicking batch file "pack.bat" will deploy the files.

The installer source is installer.iss,
that's an Inno Setup script. Please run Inno Setup after deployment.

You mayn't put so many .scr files in one folder directly.
It fails .scr installation.
There's Windows limitation in the numbers of installables at once.
